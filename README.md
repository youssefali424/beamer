# Key Concepts

The key concept of Beamer is a `BeamLocation` which represents a stack of one or more pages whose ordering and rebuild you control within `pagesBuilder`.

## Beaming

You will be extending `BeamLocation` to define your app's locations to which you can then _beam to_ using

```dart
Beamer.of(context).beamTo(MyLocation());

// or with an extension on BuildContext
context.beamTo(MyLocation());
```

or _beam to_ a specific configuration of some location;

```dart
context.beamToNamed('/books/2');

// or more explicitly
context.beamTo(
  BooksLocation(
    pathBlueprint: '/books/:bookId',
    pathParameters: {'bookId': '2'},
  ),
);
```

You can think of it as _teleporting_ (_beaming_) to another place in your app. Similar to `Navigator.of(context).pushReplacementNamed('/my-route')`, but Beamer is not limited to a single page, nor to a push _per se_. You can define an arbitrary stack of pages that gets build when you beam there. Using Beamer can feel like using many of `Navigator`'s `push/pop` methods at once.

You can carry an arbitrary key/value `data` in a location. This can be accessed from every page and updated as you travel through a location.

```dart
context.beamToNamed(
  '/book/2',
  data: {'note': 'this is my favorite book'},
);
```

## Updating

Once at a `BeamLocation`, it is preferable to update the current location instead of adding it to the `beamHistory` if you plan to stay at the same location. For example, for going from `/books` to `/books/3` (which are both handled by `BooksLocation`);

```dart
context.updateCurrentLocation(
  pathParameters: {'bookId': '3'},
  data: {'note': 'this is not my favorite book'},
);
```

**Note** that both beaming functions (`beamTo` and `BeamToNamed`) will implicitly do this for you when you try to beam to a location which you're currently on. You can turn that off by setting `BeamerRouterDelegate.preferUpdate` to `false`.

If unsure what is your current location; `context.currentBeamLocation`.

## Beaming Back

All `BeamLocation`s that you visited are kept in `beamHistory`. Therefore, there is an ability to _beam back_ to the previous location. For example, after spending some time on `/books` and `/books/3`, say you beam to `/articles` which is handled by another `BeamLocation` (e.g. `ArticlesLocation`). From there, you can get back to your previous location as it were when you left, i.e. `/books/3`;

```dart
context.beamBack();
```

**Note** that Beamer will remove duplicate locations from `beamHistory` as you go. For example, if you visit `BooksLocation`, `ArticlesLocation` and then `BooksLocation` again, the first instance of `BooksLocation` will be removed from history and `beamHistory` will be `[ArticlesLocation,BooksLocation]` instead of `[BooksLocation,ArticlesLocation,BooksLocation]`. You can turn that off by setting `BeamerRouterDelegate.removeDuplicateHistory` to `false`.

You can check whether you can beam back with `context.canBeamBack` or even inspect the location you'll be beaming back to: `context.beamBackLocation`.

---

**Note** that "Navigator 1.0" can be used alongside Beamer. You can easily `push` or `pop` pages with `Navigator.of(context)`, but those will not be contributing to the URI. This is often needed when some info/helper page needs to be shown that doesn't influence the browser's URL. And of course, when using Beamer on mobile, this is a non-issue as there is no URL.

# Examples

## Books

Here is a recreation of books example from [this article](https://medium.com/flutter/learning-flutters-new-navigation-and-routing-system-7c9068155ade) where you can learn a lot about Navigator 2.0. See [Example](https://pub.dev/packages/beamer/example) for full application code of this example.

## Advanced Books

For a step further, we add more flows to demonstrate the power of Beamer. The full code is available [here](https://github.com/slovnicki/beamer_examples/tree/master/advanced_books).

<p align="center">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/slovnicki/beamer_examples/master/advanced_books/example-advanced-books.gif" alt="example-advanced-books" width="520">

## Deep Location

You can instantly beam to a location in your app that has many pages stacked (deep linking) and then pop them one by one or simply `beamBack` to where you came from. The full code is available [here](https://github.com/slovnicki/beamer_examples/tree/master/deep_location). Note that `beamBackOnPop` parameter of `beamTo` might be useful here to override `AppBar`'s `pop` with `beamBack`.

<p align="center">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/slovnicki/beamer_examples/master/deep_location/example-deep-location.gif" alt="example-deep-location" width="260">

```dart
ElevatedButton(
  onPressed: () => context.beamTo(DeepLocation('/a/b/c/d')),
  // onPressed: () => context.beamTo(DeepLocation('/a/b/c/d'), beamBackOnPop: true),
  child: Text('Beam deep'),
),
```

## Location Builder

You can override `BeamLocation.builder` to provide some data to the entire location, i.e. to all of the `pages`. The full code is available [here](https://github.com/slovnicki/beamer_examples/tree/master/location_builder).

<p align="center">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/slovnicki/beamer_examples/master/location_builder/example-location-builder.gif" alt="example-location-builder"  width="260">

```dart
// in your location implementation
@override
Widget builder(BuildContext context, Navigator navigator) {
  return MyProvider<MyObject>(
    create: (context) => MyObject(),
    child: navigator,
  );
}
```

## Guards

You can define global guards (for example, authentication guard) or location guards that keep a specific location safe. The full code is available [here](https://github.com/slovnicki/beamer_examples/tree/master/guards).

<p align="center">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/slovnicki/beamer_examples/master/guards/example-guards.gif" alt="example-guards"  width="520">

- Global Guards

```dart
BeamerRouterDelegate(
  initialLocation: initialLocation,
  guards: [
    BeamGuard(
      pathBlueprints: ['/books*'],
      check: (context, location) => AuthenticationStateProvider.of(context).isAuthenticated.value,
      beamTo: (context) => LoginLocation(),
    ),
  ],
),
```

- Location (local) Guards

```dart
// in your location implementation
@override
List<BeamGuard> get guards => [
  BeamGuard(
    pathBlueprints: ['/books/*'],
    check: (context, location) => location.pathParameters['bookId'] != '2',
    showPage: forbiddenPage,
  ),
];
```

## Beamer Widget

An example of putting `Beamer`(s) into the Widget tree. _This is not yet fully functional for web usage_; setting the URL from browser doesn't update the state properly. It should work when [nested routers issue](https://github.com/slovnicki/beamer/issues/4) is settled.

        ),
        bottomNavigationBar: BottomNavigationBar(
          currentIndex: _currentIndex,
          items: [
            BottomNavigationBarItem(label: 'A', icon: Icon(Icons.article)),
            BottomNavigationBarItem(label: 'B', icon: Icon(Icons.book)),
          ],
          onTap: (index) => setState(() => _currentIndex = index),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

# Usage
## On Entire App

In order to use Beamer on your entire app, you must (as per [official documentation](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Router-class.html)) construct your `*App` widget with `.router` constructor to which (along with all your regular `*App` attributes) you provide

- `routerDelegate` that controls (re)building of `Navigator` pages and
- `routeInformationParser` that decides which URI corresponds to which `Router` state/configuration, in our case - `BeamLocation`.

Here you use the Beamer implementation of those - `BeamerRouterDelegate` and `BeamerRouteInformationParser`, to which you pass your `BeamLocation`s.

```dart
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  final routerDelegate = BeamerRouterDelegate(
    beamLocations: [
      HomeLocation(),
      BooksLocation(),
    ],
  );
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp.router(
      routerDelegate: routerDelegate,
      routeInformationParser: BeamerRouteInformationParser(),
      backButtonDispatcher:
          BeamerBackButtonDispatcher(delegate: routerDelegate),
    );
  }
}
```

## As a Widget

_(not yet fully functional on web, regarding URL parsing)_

```dart
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        body: Beamer(
          beamLocations: [
            HomeLocation(),
            BooksLocation(),
          ],
        ),
        ...
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

## General Notes

- When extending `BeamLocation`, two methods need to be implemented; `pathBlueprints` and `pagesBuilder`.
  - `pagesBuilder` returns a stack of pages that will be built by `Navigator` when you beam there, and `pathBlueprints` is there for Beamer to decide which `BeamLocation` corresponds to a URL coming from browser.
  - `BeamLocation` takes query and path parameters from URI. The `:` is necessary in `pathBlueprints` if you _might_ get path parameter from browser.

- `BeamPage`'s child is an arbitrary `Widgets` that represent your app screen / page.
  - `key` is important for `Navigator` to optimize rebuilds. This should be a unique value for "page state".
  - `BeamPage` creates `MaterialPageRoute`, but you can extend `BeamPage` and override `createRoute` to make your own implementation instead.

# Migrating

## From 0.7 to 0.8

- rename `pages` to `pagesBuilder` in `BeamLocation`s
- pass `beamLocations` to `BeamerRouterDelegate` instead of `BeamerRouteInformationParser`. See [Usage](#usage)
## From 0.4 to 0.5

- instead of wrapping `MaterialApp` with `Beamer`, use `*App.router()`
- `String BeamLocation.pathBlueprint` is now `List<String> BeamLocation.pathBlueprints`
- `BeamLocation.withParameters` constructor is removed and all parameters are handled with 1 constructor. See example if you need `super`.
- `BeamPage.page` is now called `BeamPage.child`
